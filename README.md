### 17 December, 2018
**Pantry** is a basic ingredient aggregator tool designed to simplify searching for recipes online.
We hope to solve common issues of online recipes being flooded with advertisements and being too disorganized. In addition, **Pantry** will help home cooks by generating a shopping list automatically, saving time when planning ahead.

Powered by Yummly, Pantry will be able to:
* Search for recipes
* Save users' favorite recipes
* Generate a shopping list from recipe ingredients, by recipe

Target audience:
* Home cooks
* Meal planners
